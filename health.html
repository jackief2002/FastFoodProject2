                <h1><br> McDonalds </h1>
                <p>When it comes to kids' meals, you really can't go wrong by choosing a Happy Meal with chicken McNuggets (four pieces), apple slices, a low-fat yogurt stick and low-fat milk. The chain also offers a Mighty Kid's Meal, which includes six chicken McNuggets, for bigger appetites. We love McDonald's fruit and yogurt parfait, a mix of low-fat yogurt with strawberries, blueberries and crunchy granola. It's tasty, low in saturated fat and calcium-rich and offers berry antioxidants -- and therefore a no-brainer for vegetarians. It is on the lighter side, though, so we consider it more of a mini-meal or snack, unless you pair it with a side salad. For the calorie consumers, if you want a simple grilled chicken salad with tomatoes and shredded cheese, order the bacon ranch grilled chicken salad, and omit the bacon. It may sound silly, but it will lower the calories (from 320 to 230) and sodium (from 1,090 milligrams to 730 milligrams). We also recommend using only half the packet of ranch dressing, which brings the salad total to 330 calories.</p>

                <h1><br> Burger King </h1>
                <p>It's hard to find a truly healthy meal at any fast food restaurant. You probably won't find important whole grains, the leanest meats and lots of green leafy vegetables in the drive-thru lane. Burger King is no different. Even the menu options that sound healthy are actually high in fat and calories. Your best bet is to choose smaller menu items to â€‹keep portion sizes under control. You can keep the calorie count low with these combinations. What food should you avoid if you're trying to maintain a healthy diet? The Bacon king provides 1150 calories and 79 grams of fat. And breakfast items can set you up a with a day's worth of fat and calories. The Egg-normous Burrito provides 910 calories and 55 grams of fat and the King Croissanwich with double sausage provides 700 calories and 51 grams of fat. Almost everyone visits a fast food restaurant at some point. Enjoying a burger and fries at your favorite spot can be part of a healthy diet as long as you visit occasionally. Remember that you can access nutritional information for Burger King menu items online or download the full menu from their website. A single meal won't derail your diet, but be careful to make good menu choices based on the actual calorie counts and nutritional data rather than on the healthy sounding name.</p>

                <h1><br> Subways </h1>
                <p>Most of our sandwich picks come from Subway's Fresh Fit menu, which includes sandwiches that are low in saturated fat, are sensible in calories and have less sodium than some of the other sandwiches. When it comes to breads, the chain's nine-grain wheat bread and multigrain flatbread are richest in whole grains and fiber. The standard build for all sandwiches and salads contains five fresh veggies -- lettuce, tomato, cucumbers, peppers and onions -- but you are welcome to add or subtract toppings as you wish. At Subway, kids can enjoy the same sandwiches as grownups, but in smaller sizes. A "Fresh Fit for Kids Meal" includes a Fresh Fit mini sub, which is a 4-inch sandwich that is low in saturated fat and calories. Subways top pick is the roast beef mini, as it's the most protein-rich of the four kids' sandwich options, and it's the lowest-sodium meat option. For a vegetarian kids option, choose the Veggie Delite sandwich with shredded Monterey cheddar, which has less than half the sodium of processed American cheese.
