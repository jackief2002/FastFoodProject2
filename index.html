                <h3 class="text-center">The history of fast food dates back to 1921 when the first fast food chain, White Castle, was founded. Up until that time, hamburgers were considered low-budget food mainly sold at fairs and from food carts. White Castle aimed to change America's view of the hamburger. The first White Castle restaurant featured an open kitchen area where customers could see their food being prepared. The industry grew explosively since then. </h3>

                <h3 class = "text-center"> In general, food from a particular chain tends to taste the same no matter which restaurant you visit; there are several reasons behind this. The food itself is mass produced in a factory and then frozen. Restaurants store this frozen food in large, walk-in freezers. Cooks reheat it rather than making it from scratch. Nextly, the factory adds artificial and natural flavors to the food to make sure it all tastes the same. These flavors are manufactured separate factories.
Also, the equipment in the kitchen cooks all of the food for the same amount of time. For example, in some chains, a conveyor belt carries hamburger patties through a broiler. The broiler cooks the patties on both sides simultaneously, and the conveyor belt makes sure they're cooked for precisely the right amount of time. Finally, the employees in different restaurants follow the same instructions for cooking, dressing and packaging the food. </h3>

                <h3 class="text-center">Fast food didn't catch on immediately, but it did begin to slowly develop along with the popularity of the automobile. As Americans became more mobile, frequent traveling led to a desire for quicker food on the go. Due to that, fast food has made a huge impact on American lifestyle. It is known that most Americans eat a significant amount of fast food. Letâ€™s see what baggage these habits hold.</h3>
